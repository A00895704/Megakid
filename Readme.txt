Hello README reader!,

Megakid is a final academic project I had for a first year game design course at Surrey SFU. I used processing for to make it. Megakid is a 
2D action platformer(think Megaman hence the name). The goal for this project was 3 levels 2 being regular platforming stages and 3rd being a 
boss battle. Unfortunately I did not finish developing the game as I ran out of time and aimed for way too much. Everything is basic shapes btw :D

===How to Run===
1.Download and install processing
2.Run sketch_ffproj.pde

===================Features and Remarks=================================

I ran into many bugs and ended up learning a lot of how to implement basic platformer mechanics such as gravity, 
wall slide, wall jump, movement with platforms and so on. I had a lot of fun implementing gravity(It took me a full day(12+ hrs) to get it working).
Wall slide and wall jump became an extension of gravity. I was giddish by the time I finished that day. There are 3 monsters in the game and 1 boss.
A metataur(mining helm no body guys), a wolf that jumps at you, a teleporting mage and a fast moving boss. There is also 1 upgrade in a very weird spot
that gives a final charge level to your blaster. 

Overall I am mildly satisfied with this project. The only feature I wish I got working was sound. I really wanted to add sounds for the blaster,
background music and death sounds as a minimum. If I got another shot at this, I would make only a single level with a boss at the end of it with
an enrage mechanic. I've been really impressed with metroidvanias(indivisible, hollow knight, dead cells) lately as well as cuphead so I'd love to do something similar in the future 
as a personal project probably no where as big so something like cuphead or iwannabetheguy/iwannabetheboshy. And defnitely not using processing. Preferably either
unity or gamemaker.

TLDR; -Academic project using processing.
		-unfinished due to aiming for too big, all polygons
		-learned to code gravity, wall slide, wall jump and some simple enemy ai
		-mildly satisfied though I wish I implemented sound
		-would love to make another platformer preferably not using processing
